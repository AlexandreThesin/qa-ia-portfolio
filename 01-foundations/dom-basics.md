# DOM & Frontend Basics – QA Perspective

Learned concepts:
- HTML structure
- DOM tree (parent / child)
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Events (click)

QA observations:
- UI tests interact with the DOM, not the “screen”
- Small DOM changes can break automation
- Frontend bugs often come from JS or data timing
