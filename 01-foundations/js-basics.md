# JavaScript Basics for QA

Concepts explored in browser console:
- Variables
- Objects (similar to JSON)
- Functions
- Events
- Async behavior (setTimeout)
- JSON parsing

QA observations:
- UI behavior is driven by JS events
- API data is stored in variables and objects
- Async operations can cause flaky tests
